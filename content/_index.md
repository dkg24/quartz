Example Intro:



**These mean a lot to me:**

"If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty secondsâ€™ worth of distance run, 
Yours is the Earth and everything thatâ€™s in it, 
Andâ€”which is moreâ€”youâ€™ll be a Man, my son!" - Kipling


"If one advances confidently in the directions of his dreams, 
and endeavors to live the life he has imagined, 
he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours ." -Thoreau
